    <p>
      The purpose of this page is simply to list out in a table varying interview
      questions with corresponding links to recordings that answer those questions.
      Another part of the page will help references tools and websites used to compile
      the list of questions as well as recording tips.  I've included my own personal
      answers as examples and reference.
